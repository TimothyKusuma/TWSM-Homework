Here's an analysis of the metrics:\n","\n","Precision: Precision represents the proportion of correctly predicted instances among the predicted instances for each class. The precision for the 'negative' class is relatively high (0.95), but the precisions for the 'neutral' and 'positive' classes are low (0.22 and 0.56, respectively). This indicates that the classifier tends to misclassify instances as 'neutral' or 'positive' when they are actually 'negative'.\n","\n","Recall: Recall represents the proportion of correctly predicted instances among the actual instances for each class. The recall for the 'negative' class is very low (0.06), indicating that the classifier fails to identify the majority of 'negative' instances. The recall for the 'neutral' class is high (0.94), suggesting that the classifier performs well in identifying 'neutral' instances. The recall for the 'positive' class is also relatively low (0.25).\n","\n","F1-score: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure between the two. The F1-score for the 'negative' class is low (0.12), indicating poor performance. The F1-scores for the 'neutral' and 'positive' classes are also relatively low (0.36 and 0.34, respectively).\n","\n","Overall, the weighted average F1-score is only 0.20, which is quite low. This suggests that the 'sentiment_tb_desc' column is not an effective sentiment classifier, as it fails to accurately predict sentiment across different classes.\n","\n","It's worth noting that sentiment analysis can be a challenging task, and the results may vary depending on the specific dataset and the techniques used. Further improvements in the feature engineering, model selection, or fine-tuning could potentially enhance the performance of the sentiment classifier."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["import seaborn as

The k-means clustering approach achieves a precision of 0.65 for the 'negative' sentiment class and 0.58 for the 'positive' sentiment class. However, it has a precision of 0.0 for the 'neutral' sentiment class, indicating that none of the instances were correctly predicted as 'neutral'. In comparison, the previous methods achieved higher precision scores for the sentiment classes, indicating better performance in correctly identifying instances for each class.\n","\n","Recall: The recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of all instances of each sentiment class. The k-means clustering approach achieves a high recall of 0.97 for the 'negative' sentiment class, indicating that it identifies a large portion of 'negative' instances correctly. However, the recall for the 'neutral' sentiment class is 0.0, indicating that none of the instances were correctly predicted as 'neutral'. The recall for the 'positive' sentiment class is 0.24, indicating that a significant number of positive instances are not correctly identified by the clustering algorithm. In comparison, the previous methods achieved higher recall scores for the sentiment classes, indicating better performance in capturing all instances of each class.\n","\n","F1-score: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balance between the two metrics. The k-means clustering approach achieves an F1-score of 0.78 for the 'negative' sentiment class and 0.34 for the 'positive' sentiment class. However, the F1-score for the 'neutral' sentiment class is 0.0, indicating that the clustering algorithm fails to correctly predict any instances as 'neutral'. In comparison, the previous methods achieved higher F1-scores for the sentiment classes, indicating better overall performance in capturing both precision and recall.\n","\n","Accuracy: The accuracy measures the overall correctness of the predictions across all sentiment classes. The k-means clustering approach achieves an accuracy of 0.65, indicating that 65% of instances are correctly classified. However, it is important to note that the accuracy alone does not provide a complete picture of the performance, especially when the classes are imbalanced or some classes are not predicted at all. In this case, the low performance in predicting the 'neutral' sentiment class contributes to the lower accuracy compared to the previous methods.\n","\n","Based on the precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy values, the k-means clustering approach performs relatively worse compared to the previous methods. The previous methods, such as textblob-based sentiment analysis and random forest classification, are specifically designed for sentiment analysis tasks and achieve higher performance in accurately predicting sentiment classes. The k-means clustering approach, being an unsupervised method, struggles to capture the sentiment classes effectively, particularly the 'neutral' sentiment class, resulting in lower performance metrics overall."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMOF/RSEiqUFA/881q0jSgo","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
